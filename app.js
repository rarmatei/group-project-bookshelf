 * 2. Filter the books data to find books that are **not** marked as read
 * 3. Show the list of unread books in the "Unread Books" table. The book's
 *    title, author and publish date should be shown.
 * 4. Show the current number of unread books in the Unread Books Count
 * 5. Also filter the books data to find books that are marked as read
 * 6. Show the list of read books in the "Read Books" table and show the number
 *    of read books in the Read Books Count
 * 7. Clicking on a book in the "Read Books" table should "star" it. Starred
 *    books should appear with a yellow background. This can be applied by
 *    adding the `starred` class to the table row (`<tr>`) for each starred book
